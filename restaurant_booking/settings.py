to me

Hi Finnbarr,

The assessment of your Portfolio Project 4: Full-Stack Toolkit has just been completed.

The links you submitted were:

Deployed project
Source code
You have received the following feedback from the assessor:

Please find the detailed mapping of criteria here.

LO1 - Use an Agile methodology to plan and design a Full-Stack Web application using an MVC framework and related contemporary technologies:
Criterion	Meets Criterion	Reason
1.1	Yes	Displayed a good grasp of UX understanding and its role in the development process by creating a website that adheres to the user needs
1.2	Yes	Minor responsiveness issues
1.3	Yes	The web application allows users to store and manipulate data records about a particular domain
1.4	Yes	One or more fully original customized Django model is present
1.5	Yes	Excellent use of Agile software development tools, with a well laid-out kanban board with sprints and milestones clearly documented.
1.6	Yes	An issue exists for each user story and is mapped to a kanban board, which can be segmented into sprints
1.7	No	Fails to pass validation and has compelling code issues
1.8	Yes	Sufficient custom logic present
1.9	Yes	Python functions implementing loops and iterations is evident throughout the repo and website.
1.10	No	No attempt at following consistent standards for readability
1.11	Yes	Files are named clearly and located in appropriately named directories as per the conventions
1.12	Yes	All User Stories are documented within the Agile tool, and mapped to project goals
1.13	Yes	The design process and its reasoning are documented but could be improved. Wireframes, mockups and diagrams created as part of the design process have been included in the README
Additional		Generally good work has been done here as regards design work. Resources are clear in their intentions. Users are able to interact with the application largely without issues. The site is mostly responsive, with the exception of the special requests route, where the contact form overlaps the header on smaller screen sizes, and may cause the user issues with navigation. As regards functionality, users are able to perform CRUD operations on bookings without issues.
Users are able to send special requests for bookings. This functionality broadly works, with some issues present. As noted on smaller screen sizes the form overlaps the heading. Additionally the form lacks input validation, and the form can be submitted without entering information in the dietary preferences and additional notes fields. Additionally a user can access this page even if they have already sent a request for a booking. Attempting to submit the form again will result in a message advising the user they've already sent a message. Ideally a user shouldn't be able to access this route at all if they are only permitted to send one contact request per booking. Furthermore, the model has not been registered on the backend admin panel. As a result it can not be confirmed if the data is being saved successfully.
Agile usage has been well implemented, with indication of milestone planning, acceptance criteria, and prioritisation. There are some code validation concerns, with files such as the views.py file in the bookings app failing PEP8 validation with a number of issues. Python functions are additionally missing explanatory docstrings throughout the code base. There are additionally some minor HTML validation concerns.
LO2 - Implement a data model, application features and business logic to manage, query and manipulate data to meet given needs in a particular real-world domain:
Criterion	Meets Criterion	Reason
2.1	Yes	Data is retained in a homogeneous and coordinated way that enhances future management and usability
2.2	Yes	Users are able to perform CRUD operations that are reflected on the backend database
2.3	Yes	Relevant messages relayed to the user on performing CRUD operations and suitable navigation in place upon completing operations.
2.4	Yes	Forms are present but could use additional validation checks for certain data types. Update forms are not prefilled with existing data
Additional		Data models in use are appropriate to the application requirements. CRUD all works as intended and there is appropriate feedback to the user on successful or failed CRUD attempts. The booking route has good levels of input validation in place, with users being unable to book dates in the past, and being restricted to the numbers they can book for. As noted however the booking special requests form lacks similar input validation. Additionally, as noted the model is not registered on the backend admin panel. As such the effectiveness of the form submission can not be confirmed.
LO3 - Identify and apply authorisation, authentication and permission features in a Full-Stack web application solution:
Criterion	Meets Criterion	Reason
3.1	Yes	Users are able to register and login to the application without issue
3.2	Yes	Indication of authentication status on display to the user (eg in the navbar, through welcome messages etc..)
3.3	Yes	Non logged in users are unable to access restricted content or functionality. Appropriate redirection in place on trying to access these directly through the URL
Additional		Authentication works well in the application and users can register and log in and out of the application without issue. Additionally there are checks in place to make sure a user can't reach pages to effect change to the database beyond the permissions allowed to them, even by directly entering the URL. This is good practice. One thing to note is that users can access the form to send special requests for other user's bookings via direct URL entry. While they can not submit the form, ideally they shouldn't be able to access the route at all.
LO4 - Create automated tests for a Full-Stack Web application using an MVC framework and related contemporary technologies:
Criterion	Meets Criterion	Reason
4.1	Yes	Full set of manual tests implemented and documented covering most functionalities within the project
4.2	Yes	Full set of manual tests implemented and documented covering most functionalities within the project
4.3	No	Testing write-ups are present and cover most automated and/or manual tests, but scope exists for more detail
Additional		Testing writeups consist of a table noting the functionality that is being tested, along with a screenshot to show the functionality. Ideally here the testing steps taken should be documented. Additionally there is a lack of evidence of validation testing, and the project currently fails validation. Ensure to fully document all testing steps taken and produce evidence of the results of tools such as code validators. In the event of all manual testing, the individual feature testing steps taken should be identified along with the expected and actual outcome of the tests.
LO5 - Use a distributed version control system and a repository hosting service to document, develop and maintain a Full-Stack Web application using an MVC framework and related contemporary technologies.:
Criterion	Meets Criterion	Reason
5.1	Yes	Audit trail of Git commits suggests educated usage of version control - commit messages are well written and follow a consistent pattern
5.2	No	Environment variable values are visible in the final version of the code in the repository
Additional		Git was used effectively as version control, with commits covering incremental changes and following a consistent messaging pattern. Well done here. The env.py file is present in the repository and contains sensitive information. This must be hidden through the use a .gitignore file.
LO6 - Deploy a Full-Stack Web application using an MVC framework and related contemporary technologies to a cloud-based platform:
Criterion	Meets Criterion	Reason
6.1	Yes	Deployed final code version works without issues and is equivalent to the development branch
6.2	Yes	No commented code or broken links
6.3	Yes	The deployment process documented but could be more elaborate for another user to deploy on the local system
6.4	No	Sensitive information exists in the code base and/or DEBUG mode is turned on.
Additional		The application has been deployed to Heroku, where it is running without issues and matches up to submitted content. As noted the env.py file is present in the repository, which must be hidden from public access. There is scope for more details in Deployment writeups. The deployment section should cover the steps required to deploy the project, including aspects such as files to be created, packages to be installed, resources to be set up, environment variables to be set, etc... steps to clone and run the project locally can be included as well. At an ideal level a user could clone, run, and deploy the project based on information present in the deployment section without referencing outside documentation.
LO7 - Understand and use object-based software concepts:
Criterion	Meets Criterion	Reason
7.1	Yes	An abstract data model presented that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another throughout the application
Additional		As noted the data models in use are appropriate for the application requirements.
You have received the following textual feedback from the assessor for Merit Criteria to give you an idea of what parts of the project were done particularly well.

Merit Criteria Comments:
Criterion	Meets Criterion	Reason
1.1	No	Some minor responsiveness issues
1.2	Yes	Template code is valid, well organized and displays a solid understanding of template tags and inheritance
1.3	Yes	Different epics mapped to milestones which contain user stories for each feature within the epic .
1.4	Yes	User stories have a well-defined set of acceptance criteria to indicate when a user story has been met.
1.5	Yes	User stories are prioritised based on importance to project goals. Prioritised user stories are clearly identifiable through relevant tags
2.1	Yes	Website intuitively provides options for effective user actions
2.2	No	Fails to pass through the official validator, and has significant code issues in the console and/or front-end
2.3	Yes	The purpose is obvious to new users through imagery, text and layout
2.4	Yes	Database configuration is set appropriately in the settings file and the connection string is hidden through environment variables
2.5	No	sensitive information present in repository
2.6	No	Not all CRUD functionality can be verified
2.7	Yes	suitable feedback system implemented to notify users of successful CRUD operations.
3.1	Yes	Clearly defined intent behind the development of the project for the targeted audience
4.1	No	Scope for additional detail in testing
5.1	No	Data schema and relationships aren't clearly laid out in the documentation
5.2	Yes	The extensive commit history is evidence of the use of best practice
6.1	No	The deployment process documented but could be more elaborate for another user to deploy the project on a local system
7.1	No	Full efficiency of model code can not be verified.
Additional		Some of those issues noted will result in the requisite merit criteria not being met here.
Overall comments from the assessor are as follows:

This project demonstrates solid design and functionality, with users able to interact with the site effectively and perform CRUD operations on bookings. The application is mostly responsive, with a clear layout and good navigation structure, though some minor design issues remain—particularly on the special requests route, where the contact form overlaps the header on smaller screens. Functionality is further enhanced by allowing users to submit special requests, and while this feature works, it lacks proper input validation, with users being able to submit empty forms, and presents UX concerns such as allowing users to access the form unnecessarily after submission. Agile methodologies are well applied, with clear milestone planning and prioritisation visible. Authentication and access control are implemented securely, and Git is used effectively with consistent, meaningful commit messages. 

However, there are several areas requiring attention. The special requests form should include stricter input validation and logic to prevent access once a submission has been made. Additionally, the associated model is not registered in the admin panel, limiting visibility into form submissions. Testing documentation is limited, lacking step-by-step detail and evidence of validation results—areas that will be increasingly important in future, more complex projects. Code quality should also be improved by addressing PEP8 issues and adding explanatory docstrings to Python functions. The presence of the env.py file in the repository is a critical oversight, exposing sensitive data and indicating a need for better use of .gitignore. Lastly, the deployment section in the README should be expanded to include comprehensive steps for deploying and running the project, ensuring it can be replicated without relying on external documentation.

Overall a lot of great work has been done thus far, with a few corrections to be made to ensure the project meets passing standards. Looking forward to reviewing the revised application.

We are sorry to inform you that your project submission has not been successful in meeting the criteria above and has resulted in a FAIL grade. Please note that the feedback you have received is personal to you and is considered private so is not to be shared.

I’m sorry to see you didn’t pass on this round—but you’ve got very clear, actionable feedback to get you across the line. Here’s a suggested plan of attack:

Lock down sensitive data

Add env.py (and any other secrets) to .gitignore so they never hit your repo.

Move all keys/config into real environment variables.

Tighten up your special-requests form

Add field‐level validation (make “dietary preferences” and “notes” required or handle empty inputs).

Prevent users from even reaching the form if they’ve already submitted for that booking.

Register the SpecialRequest model in Django’s admin so you can confirm submissions.

Polish code quality & docs

Run flake8/pycodestyle across your views.py (and the rest of the code) and fix the remaining errors.

Add docstrings to your Python functions explaining what they do, their inputs, and outputs.

Expand your testing artifacts

For each manual test, document: the exact steps you took, expected vs. actual outcome, and include screenshots or console outputs.

Add a few simple automated tests (e.g. “creating a booking with invalid data is rejected”) to demonstrate use of Django’s test framework.

Beef up your deployment instructions

In your README (or a dedicated DEPLOY.md), list every step a new developer needs: cloning, creating virtualenv, installing requirements, setting environment variables, running migrations, collecting static files, and launching on Heroku (or locally).

Fix responsive layout issues

On small screens the special-requests header is overlapped—adjust your CSS/Bootstrap grid so the form and heading stack properly.

Next steps:

Let me know which area you’d like to tackle first (e.g. “I want to fix the env.py issue”), and I can walk you through exactly how to implement the changes.

If you’d like, we can also draft commit message guidelines or create a mini‐kanban board to track these fixes.

Where would you like to begin?

OK So what I want to do is pass this project So what I'm going to do is get it to a standard where I can pass it tell me the files you want to see to make sure that I have done everything in order to pass


ChatGPT said:

Thought for 4 seconds
To make sure you’ve addressed all the assessor’s fail‐points and are ready to pass, I’ll need to review the key files where those changes live. Please share (or paste) the contents of:

.gitignore
– To confirm env.py (and any other secrets) are excluded.

settings.py (in your Django project)
– To verify you’re now loading secrets via real environment variables.

env.py (if it still exists)
– To confirm it’s removed or empty.

Bookings app

forms.py (your SpecialRequest form)

Make sure required fields and validation logic are in place.

views.py (especially the special‐requests view)

To check you’re blocking repeat access and enforcing form validation.

models.py & admin.py

To verify the SpecialRequest model is registered in the admin.

Templates

templates/bookings/special_request.html (or similar)

templates/base.html (navbar/auth status display)

So I can confirm your CSS/Bootstrap fixes for small-screen responsiveness.

Static CSS/SCSS

Any custom stylesheet where you adjusted the mobile layout.

Tests

Your tests/ folder or tests.py files—both manual-test write-ups and any automated Django tests.

README.md (or a separate DEPLOY.md)

To check your updated deployment instructions (cloning, env vars, migrations, collectstatic, Heroku steps, etc.).

requirements.txt

Just to make sure nothing’s missing for your deployment or test suite.

Once you’ve got those ready, paste them in (or attach links/snippets) and I’ll walk through each one to confirm you’ve hit every criterion.

I have added them all to the project files take a look and tell me what you think let me know if I've missed any

Thought for 9 seconds


ChatGPT said:
You’ve made excellent headway—most of the assessor’s “fail” items have been addressed—but I still see a handful of outstanding issues you’ll want to fix before resubmitting:

1. Automated & Manual Tests (LO4)
Empty tests.py: You haven’t added any Django test cases yet.

Manual-test write-up: Your Test Plan table is great for a quick overview, but the assessor wants step-by-step testing instructions (“click X, enter Y, expect Z”) and evidence of validation checks (e.g. trying to submit an empty special-requests form and showing the error).

Action

Write at least 2–3 simple automated tests in tests.py (e.g. booking creation, form-validation failure).

Expand your “Test Plan” section to show for each manual test:

Steps (what you did)

Expected outcome

Actual outcome (with screenshots or console logs)

2. Production Settings (LO6.4 & LO5.2)
DEBUG is still True in settings.py. In production you must read DEBUG from an env var and default to False.

You’re still importing env.py (even though it’s now in .gitignore). If you ever committed env.py it remains in your Git history—be sure to purge or rotate any secrets.

Action

Change your settings to something like:

python
Copy
Edit
DEBUG = os.getenv("DEBUG", "False") == "True"
Double-check you’ve removed any committed env.py from the repo (or rotated any leaked keys).

Make sure SECRET_KEY is only ever set via env vars.

3. Model Meta & Code Readability (LO1.7 & 1.10)
Your Meta for Booking isn’t indented under the class, so it won’t apply.

None of your view or form functions have docstrings, and there are still likely PEP8/style errors.

Action

Move the Meta class inside Booking (indented 4 spaces under it).

Run flake8/pycodestyle and fix any remaining errors.

Add a one- or two-line docstring to each view and form class/method.

4. Deployment Docs (LO6.3)
You mention “Add Procfile and runtime.txt,” but you don’t show their contents.

A fresh developer following your README still wouldn’t have a template for those files.

Action

In your Deployment section (or a new DEPLOY.md) paste example contents for:

Procfile (e.g. web: gunicorn restaurant_booking.wsgi)

runtime.txt (e.g. python-3.11.5)

Spell out the local-vs-Heroku differences (e.g. how to run static files locally).

5. HTML Validation & Responsiveness
The assessor noted minor HTML validation errors—run your pages through the W3C validator and fix any <label>/<form> issues.

Double-check your small-screen CSS tweaks actually prevent any overlapping (e.g. your special‐requests header + form).

✅ What’s done
Secrets are now ignored via .gitignore

Special-requests form validation & one-time-only logic in place

ContactMessage is registered in the admin

Booking update form is pre-filled

Basic CLI installation & Heroku push steps documented

Next step: pick one of the above (for example, “I’ll add automated tests first”), and I’ll walk you through it in detail. Let me know!






You said:
OK let's start with test I just want to add


ChatGPT said:

Thought for 47 seconds
Here are a few simple Django tests you can drop into your tests.py to get automated coverage for booking creation, model behavior, and form validation. Paste the whole block into tests.py (replacing the stub), then run ./manage.py test to see them pass or fail.

python
Copy
Edit
from django.test import TestCase
from django.urls import reverse
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from .models import Booking, ContactMessage
from .forms import BookingForm, ContactMessageForm
import datetime

class BookingModelTest(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        # create a user and a booking for tomorrow at 18:00
        self.user = User.objects.create_user(username="tester", password="pass")
        self.booking = Booking.objects.create(
            user=self.user,
            date=datetime.date.today() + datetime.timedelta(days=1),
            time=datetime.time(hour=18, minute=0),
            guests=2
        )

    def test_str_method(self):
        expected = f"{self.booking.date.strftime('%a %d %b')} at {self.booking.time.strftime('%I:%M %p')} — {self.booking.guests} guests"
        self.assertEqual(str(self.booking), expected)

    def test_default_ordering(self):
        # create a second booking at a later time on the same day
        later = Booking.objects.create(
            user=self.user,
            date=self.booking.date,
            time=datetime.time(hour=19, minute=0),
            guests=1
        )
        qs = list(Booking.objects.all())
        # should follow the Meta.ordering = ['date', 'time']
        self.assertEqual(qs, [self.booking, later])


class ContactMessageFormTest(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        # need a booking for the form’s FK
        self.user = User.objects.create_user(username="joe", password="pass")
        self.booking = Booking.objects.create(
            user=self.user,
            date=datetime.date.today() + datetime.timedelta(days=1),
            time=datetime.time(hour=18, minute=0),
            guests=2
        )

    def test_empty_form_is_invalid(self):
        form = ContactMessageForm(data={})
        self.assertFalse(form.is_valid())
        # form should complain about both required text fields
        self.assertIn('dietary_preferences', form.errors)
        self.assertIn('additional_notes', form.errors)

    def test_valid_form_saves(self):
        data = {
            'booking': self.booking.pk,
            'user': self.user.pk,
            'dietary_preferences': 'Vegetarian',
            'additional_notes': 'No peanuts, please'
        }
        form = ContactMessageForm(data=data)
        self.assertTrue(form.is_valid())
        obj = form.save()
        self.assertEqual(obj.dietary_preferences, 'Vegetarian')
        self.assertEqual(obj.booking, self.booking)
        # String repr
        self.assertIn(str(self.user), str(obj))
What these cover:

BookingModelTest checks your __str__ and that your Meta.ordering actually orders by date then time.

ContactMessageFormTest ensures the special-requests form rejects empty submissions and that a valid submission actually creates a ContactMessage instance.

Once these tests pass, you’ll have solid evidence of automated coverage for LO4. Let me know if you need help interpreting failures or adding view/URL tests next!






You said:
I've added it to the file What's next


ChatGPT said:

Thought for a couple of seconds
Great—that’s a big step forward! Here’s what I’d tackle next:

1. Run & verify your new tests
In your terminal, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python manage.py test
Make sure all your new tests in tests.py pass.

If any fail, share the error output here and we’ll fix the underlying issue.

Once they all pass, you’ll have solid automated coverage for LO4.

2. Expand your manual test documentation
The assessor also wants more detailed manual‐testing write-ups. For each feature you’ve listed, update your Test Plan to include:

Test steps (e.g. “1. Log in as user X → 2. Navigate to Special Requests → 3. Leave both fields blank → 4. Click Submit”)

Expected result (e.g. “Form is rejected; error messages appear under each field”)

Actual result (e.g. “Error messages display correctly”; include a screenshot showing the errors).

Also be sure to include a manual test showing that repeat access to the Special Requests page is blocked.

Quick checklist for your manual tests doc:
Booking creation (valid and invalid dates)

Booking update (prefilled form)

Special-requests form: empty submission, valid submission, and repeat-access restriction

Authentication gating (non-logged-in redirect)

CRUD feedback messages

Once your tests pass and your manual write-up is fleshed out, let me know, and we’ll move on to the next fail-point (e.g., switching DEBUG off, bumping up your deployment docs, etc.).

The failure is happening because your ContactMessageForm only exposes the two text fields (dietary_preferences, additional_notes), so calling form.save() by itself produces an instance with booking and user still None. In your views you correctly do:

python
Copy
Edit
msg = form.save(commit=False)
msg.booking = booking
msg.user    = request.user
msg.save()
Your test needs to do the same. Update your test_valid_form_saves to save with commit=False, set the FK fields, then call .save(). For example, replace that method in tests.py with:

python
Copy
Edit
def test_valid_form_saves(self):
    data = {
        'dietary_preferences': 'Vegetarian',
        'additional_notes':     'No peanuts, please'
    }
    form = ContactMessageForm(data=data)
    self.assertTrue(form.is_valid())

    # mirror your view logic: commit=False, set booking & user, then save
    msg = form.save(commit=False)
    msg.booking = self.booking
    msg.user    = self.user
    msg.save()

    # now all fields should be set correctly
    self.assertEqual(msg.dietary_preferences, 'Vegetarian')
    self.assertEqual(msg.additional_notes,     'No peanuts, please')
    self.assertEqual(msg.booking,              self.booking)
    self.assertEqual(msg.user,                 self.user)
    self.assertIn(str(self.user),              str(msg))
After making that change:

Run python manage.py test again.

You should see all four tests pass.

Let me know if anything else pops up!

That ImportError means Python found a def test_valid_form_saves with no indented body beneath it. Let’s fix your indentation so that everything inside the method is indented one level (4 spaces) under the def. Replace your existing method with this block in bookings/tests.py:

python
Copy
Edit
class ContactMessageFormTest(TestCase):
    def test_valid_form_saves(self):
        # only the form fields (booking & user set later)
        data = {
            'dietary_preferences': 'Vegetarian',
            'additional_notes':     'No peanuts, please'
        }
        form = ContactMessageForm(data=data)
        self.assertTrue(form.is_valid())

        # mirror view logic
        msg = form.save(commit=False)
        msg.booking = self.booking
        msg.user    = self.user
        msg.save()

        # assertions
        self.assertEqual(msg.dietary_preferences, 'Vegetarian')
        self.assertEqual(msg.additional_notes,     'No peanuts, please')
        self.assertEqual(msg.booking,              self.booking)
        self.assertEqual(msg.user,                 self.user)
        self.assertIn(str(self.user),              str(msg))
Key: every line from data = {...} through the last assertIn must be indented exactly 8 spaces from the left margin (4 spaces for the class block + 4 spaces for the method block).

After saving that, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python manage.py test
and you should see all tests pass. Let me know how it goes!

Great—your automated tests are all passing now. 🎉

Next up: Detailed Manual Testing Documentation
To satisfy LO4’s manual-testing requirements, let’s flesh out your Test Plan with step-by-step procedures, expected vs. actual outcomes, and evidence (screenshots or console logs). You can add this under a “Manual Test Plan” section in your README or in a separate TESTING.md. Here’s a template you can copy and complete:

markdown
Copy
Edit
## Manual Test Plan

### 1. Booking Creation (Invalid Date)
- **Steps:**
  1. Log in as **tester**.
  2. Navigate to **Create Booking**.
  3. Select a date in the past (e.g., yesterday).
  4. Click **Submit**.
- **Expected Outcome:**
  - The form is rejected.
  - An inline error appears: “Date cannot be in the past.”
- **Actual Outcome:**
  - _Describe what happened; attach screenshot → `screenshots/booking_invalid_date.png`_

---

### 2. Booking Creation (Valid Data)
- **Steps:**
  1. Log in as **tester**.
  2. Navigate to **Create Booking**.
  3. Select tomorrow’s date and choose 2 guests.
  4. Click **Submit**.
- **Expected Outcome:**
  - Booking is created.
  - Success message “Your booking has been created” appears.
  - User is redirected to booking list.
- **Actual Outcome:**
  - _Describe what happened; attach screenshot → `screenshots/booking_success.png`_

---

### 3. Booking Update (Prefilled Form)
- **Steps:**
  1. Log in as **tester**.
  2. Go to **My Bookings** and click **Edit** on an existing booking.
- **Expected Outcome:**
  - The form fields are prefilled with the booking’s current date, time, and guest count.
- **Actual Outcome:**
  - _Describe what happened; attach screenshot → `screenshots/booking_edit_prefill.png`_

---

### 4. Special Requests Form: Empty Submission
- **Steps:**
  1. Log in as **tester**.
  2. View one of your bookings.
  3. Click **Special Requests**.
  4. Leave **Dietary Preferences** and **Additional Notes** blank.
  5. Click **Submit**.
- **Expected Outcome:**
  - The form is rejected.
  - Error messages appear under each required field.
- **Actual Outcome:**
  - _Describe what happened; attach screenshot → `screenshots/special_requests_empty.png`_

---

### 5. Special Requests Form: Valid Submission & Block Repeat
- **Steps:**
  1. Log in as **tester**.
  2. Navigate to **Special Requests** for booking #123.
  3. Fill in valid preferences and notes.
  4. Click **Submit**.
  5. Attempt to access the **Special Requests** URL again.
- **Expected Outcome:**
  - **First** submission succeeds with a “request sent” message (`screenshots/special_requests_success.png`).
  - **Second** access redirects you (or shows a message) saying you’ve already submitted (`screenshots/special_requests_blocked.png`).
- **Actual Outcome:**
  - _Describe what happened; attach both screenshots._

---

### 6. Authentication & Permissions
- **Steps:**
  1. **Log out.**
  2. Attempt to visit `/bookings/create/` directly.
- **Expected Outcome:**
  - You’re redirected to the login page.
- **Actual Outcome:**
  - _Describe what happened; attach screenshot → `screenshots/redirect_login.png`_
Tip: Capture screenshots in a screenshots/ folder, and reference them in your markdown.

What to do now:

Copy that template into your documentation.

Perform each test, fill in the “Actual Outcome,” and add the screenshots.

Push the updated docs, then share back here once it’s done.

Once your manual tests are fully documented, we can move on to the next fail-point—switching off DEBUG, securing your settings, and updating your deployment instructions. Let me know when your manual tests are in place!

what wrong with the one I have already in my readme


ChatGPT said:

Thought for 8 seconds
Your current Test Plan in the README is a great high-level checklist, but it doesn’t meet the assessor’s requirements for manual testing detail. Here’s what’s missing:

Step-by-step procedures
Your table just names the test (e.g. “User can register an account”) without describing exactly how you performed it—what pages you visited, which buttons you clicked, what data you entered. README

Expected vs. actual outcomes
You show ✅ under “Outcome,” but you don’t spell out what you expected to happen (e.g. “User is redirected to the dashboard with a welcome message”) and what actually happened (with a screenshot). README

Validation-specific tests
The assessor wants evidence that your form validations are working. For example:

Submitting the special-requests form with both fields blank should show inline errors.

Attempting to resubmit for the same booking should redirect or block access.
Those scenarios aren’t covered in your table. README

Clear evidence of error messages
While you have screenshots, none are captioned to show the exact error text or where it appears on the form.

To fix this, expand your Test Plan into a section like:

markdown
Copy
Edit
### Special-Requests Form: Empty Submission
1. Log in as `tester`  
2. Navigate to My Bookings → Special Requests  
3. Leave **Dietary Preferences** and **Additional Notes** blank  
4. Click **Submit**

**Expected:**  
- Inline error “Please enter your dietary preferences.” under the first field  
- Inline error “Please enter additional notes.” under the second field  

**Actual:**  
- Both error messages displayed correctly  
  ![special_requests_empty.png](screenshots/special_requests_empty.png)

---

### Special-Requests Form: Block Repeat Access
1. Log in as `tester`  
2. Submit a valid special-requests form for booking #123  
3. Try to visit `/bookings/123/contact/` again  

**Expected:**  
- Redirect to My Bookings with a warning “You have already submitted a special request for this booking.”  

**Actual:**  
- Redirect works and warning appears  
  ![special_requests_blocked.png](screenshots/special_requests_blocked.png)
This format gives the assessor the exact steps you took, the behavior you expected, the behavior you observed, and clear visual proof. Once you’ve reworked your Test Plan this way in your README (or a separate TESTING.md), you’ll fully satisfy LO4.

OK perfect next

Let’s lock down your production settings next (LO5.2 & LO6.4). We need to:

Remove any hard-coded secrets

Read SECRET_KEY and DEBUG from real env vars

Ensure DEBUG defaults to False

Add env.py to .gitignore and remove it from Git history

Set a sensible ALLOWED_HOSTS for Heroku + localhost

1. Update settings.py
Replace any hard-coded lines like:

python
Copy
Edit
from .env import SECRET_KEY
DEBUG = True
with something like:

python
Copy
Edit
import os

# SECURITY KEY
SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('DJANGO_SECRET_KEY')
if not SECRET_KEY:
    raise ImproperlyConfigured("DJANGO_SECRET_KEY environment variable is not set")

# DEBUG MODE: default to False in production
DEBUG = os.getenv('DJANGO_DEBUG', 'False') == 'True'

# Hosts allowed to serve your site
ALLOWED_HOSTS = os.getenv('DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS', 'localhost,127.0.0.1').split(',')
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY must be set in your Heroku config and in any local .env file you use for development.

DJANGO_DEBUG should be 'True' only in your local dev environment—never in Heroku.

DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS lets you list your production domain (e.g. your-app.herokuapp.com) and local hosts.

2. Purge env.py from Git
Add env.py to your .gitignore if you haven’t already.

Remove it from the index (so it’s no longer tracked):

bash
Copy
Edit
git rm --cached env.py
git commit -m "Remove env.py from repository and load secrets from env vars"
Rotate any secret keys you already committed (generate a new DJANGO_SECRET_KEY).

3. Verify on Heroku & Locally
Locally, install python-dotenv, create a .env with:

ini
Copy
Edit
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=<your-local-dev-key>
DJANGO_DEBUG=True
DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
On Heroku, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
heroku config:set DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=<your-prod-key>
heroku config:set DJANGO_DEBUG=False
heroku config:set DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=your-app.herokuapp.com
Once you’ve made these changes, push them and verify:

Locally: python manage.py runserver still works without needing env.py.

Production: your Heroku app logs don’t show DEBUG = True or any secret-lookup errors.

Let me know when you’ve updated settings.py (or if you hit any errors), and we’ll move on to tightening up your deployment docs or code style.
